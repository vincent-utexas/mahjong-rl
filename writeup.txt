how to handle invalid actions?

observations
* penalties = model gets scared and tries safe actions (draw)
* skip = model learns very slowly but is more ambitious

tried
* penalty = 0.2 -> too scared
* penalty = 0.01 -> same problem as skip

penalty is a hyperparameter to be optimized
- we need a penalty large enough such that it doesn't take bad actions and
learns the rules of the game
- we need a penalty small enough such that it doesn't get scared and
only try safe actions

rewards are also a hyperparameter
- tried large rewards (x100) with -1 penalty -> too scared still
- tried moderate rewards (x10) with -0.01 penalty -> too ambitious
